    <h1>What testing is for:</h1>
<p>The application that we are testing is called Treasure Hunt and is more optimised for mobile devices
rather than desktop</p>
    <h2>How the testing will be done</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We will give the web app for testing</li>

        <li>When bugs are discovered they can be reported on the facebook page whose link is provided in the game</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we already tested the app:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The app was tested by members of other teams</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Problems they found:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There wasn't an option to cancel a skip</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How the problems were solved</h2>
